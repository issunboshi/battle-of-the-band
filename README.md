# Battle of the band (working title)

This is a simple site where you can work out your favourite song by an artist.
You select based on retrieving the top 32 songs by an artist from Last FM. We then sort those 32 songs into contests between pairs. When a round is complete we sort the songs again and repeat the process until you have just 1 song left, which by process of elimination is (probably) your favourite song by that artist.
